# TODO: create a basic structure class for each data source. eg the CSSE data
#  would have one class to describe it, which we could then use in
#  download.py, transform.py and reader.py. this would greatly simplify
#  our code. most of the code of the CSSEDownload class could be used to start
#  out here.
